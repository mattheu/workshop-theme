Example React app that we built during the training Workshop (Feb 2020)

We built a simple shop application. It isn't really functional, but demonstrates a few key concepts.

- Rendering a React app within a normal WordPress theme.
- Creating an app components
- Breaking things up into smaller components
- Passing props to components.
- Looping over arrays and outputting different elements for each.
- passing functions as props
- Component state with the useState hook.
- Passing initial state using wp_localize_script
- Fetching data after initial render using the useEffect hook.
- Persist cart data by storing it in user meta, using useEffect to do this when the cart changes.
